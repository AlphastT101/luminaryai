  LumixCore
</h1>

This repository includes the codebase for LumixCore team and LuminaryAI discord bot which is owned by us. LumixCore is an open sourcec AI project, built for transparency.


Currently, LumixCore has a functional, user-friendly dashboard, an AI playground, and an API so you can use the AI in your app. The API supports image generation and text generation. We also have a Discord bot, "LuminaryAI," which runs in the main thread, while the API runs in a separate thread. The project is built entirely with Python, using FastAPI for the API and discord.py for the bot.
