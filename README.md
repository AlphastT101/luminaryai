  XET AI
</h1>

This repository includes the codebase for XET AI team and LuminaryAI discord bot which is owned by us. XET is built by students, for the students.


Currently, XET AI has a functional, user-friendly dashboard, an AI playground, and an API so you can use the AI in your app. The API supports image generation and text generation. We also have a Discord bot, "LuminaryAI," which runs in the main thread, while the API runs in a separate thread. The project is built entirely with Python, using FastAPI for the API and discord.py for the bot.

# üìÑ API Docs

The models listed above is the only supported models and image sizes. Our API is in OpenAI format. Please join our [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/hmMBe8YyJ4) for more info.

* Python 3 code example for text generation:
```python
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI(
  base_url="https://api.xet.one/v1",
  api_key="API key here",
)

message = []
while True:
  user = input("You: ")
  user_dict = {
    "role": "user",
    "content": user
  }
  message.append(user_dict)
  completion = openai.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-4-turbo",
    messages=message
  )

  ai_dict = {
    "role": "assistant",
    "content": completion.choices[0].message.content
  }
  message.append(ai_dict)
  print(f"AI: {completion.choices[0].message.content}")
```

* Python3 code example for image generation
```python
from openai import OpenAI

openai = OpenAI(
    api_key = "API key here",
    base_url = "https://api.xet.one/v1"
)
response = openai.images.generate(
    prompt="A sunset over a mountain range",
    model="flux-dev",
    size="1024x1024"
)
print(response.data[0].url)
```
